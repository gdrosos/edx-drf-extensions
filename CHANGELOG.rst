.. There should always be an "Unreleased" section for changes pending release.

Unreleased
----------

[8.9.2] - 2023-08-31
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~
* Fixes exceptional case where JwtAuthentication should not CSRF protect a request that has both a JWT token in the authorization header and a JWT cookie, since the cookie should be ignored.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Updated one of the values of the custom attribute jwt_auth_result from 'skipped' to 'n/a'.


[8.9.1] - 2023-08-22
--------------------

Removed
~~~~~~~

* Removed unused direct dependency on ``six``.
* Removed unused direct dependency on ``python-dateutil``.


Fixed
~~~~~
* Fixed Django 40 middleware deprecation warning

[8.9.0] - 2023-08-14
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added capability to forgive JWT cookie authentication failures as a replacement for the now deprecated ``USE-JWT-COOKIE`` header. See DEPR https://github.com/openedx/edx-drf-extensions/issues/371.
  * For now, this capability must be enabled using the ``ENABLE_FORGIVING_JWT_COOKIES`` toggle.
  * Added temporary custom attributes ``is_forgiving_jwt_cookies_enabled`` and ``use_jwt_cookie_requested`` to help with this deprecation.
* Added custom attributes ``has_jwt_cookie`` and ``jwt_auth_result`` for JWT authentication observability.

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Two features that were gated on the presence of the ``USE-JWT-COOKIE`` header will now be gated on the presence of a JWT cookie instead, regardless of the state of the new ``ENABLE_FORGIVING_JWT_COOKIES`` toggle. The new behavior should be nearly equivalent in most cases, and should cause no issues in the exceptional cases. The two features include CSRF protection for JWT cookies, and the setting of the request user when ``ENABLE_SET_REQUEST_USER_FOR_JWT_COOKIE`` is enabled.

[8.8.0] - 2023-05-16
--------------------

Removed
~~~~~~~

* Removed dependency on ``pyjwkest``. Uses existing PyJWT dependency instead.

**Warning:** This change causes edx-drf-extensions to become a bit more strict about how it handles unexpected whitespace inside of Base64-encoded keys. For example, the following JSON is hard-wrapped inside a YAML single-quoted string, and edx-drf-extensions will start failing to load this in version 8.8.0::

    JWT_PUBLIC_SIGNING_JWK_SET: '{
      "keys": [
        {
          "e": "AQAB",
          "kid": "prod-key-001",
          "kty": "RSA",
          "n": "VGhpcyBpcyBqdXN0IHNvbWUgZGVtb25zdHJhd
             GlvbiB0ZXh0IHJhdGhlciB0aGFuIGFjdHVhbCBrZ
             XkgbWF0ZXJpYWwuICAK"
          }
        ]
      }'

Newlines are ignored within Base64, but are illegal inside JSON strings. However, the YAML parser actually replaces the newlines with single spaces due to the single-quoting, so the JSON will actually contain a modulus (``n``) value with two spaces breaking up the Base64. Spaces are in turn not allowed in Base64. Due to interactions between various Base64 parsers, URL-safe encoding, and how padding is handled by the Python base64 standard library, this will be read as intended by pyjwkest but not by PyJWT. This is not a bug, just a difference in how malformed inputs are handled.

The safe way to encode this JSON is without hard wrapping::

    JWT_PUBLIC_SIGNING_JWK_SET: |
      {
        "keys": [
          {
            "e": "AQAB",
            "kid": "prod-key-001",
            "kty": "RSA",
            "n": "VGhpcyBpcyBqdXN0IHNvbWUgZGVtb25zdHJhdGlvbiB0ZXh0IHJhdGhlciB0aGFuIGFjdHVhbCBrZXkgbWF0ZXJpYWwuICAK"
          }
        ]
      }

Before upgrading to version 8.8.0, ensure your keys are properly encoded with no whitespace of any sort inside of runs of Base64.

[8.7.0] - 2023-04-14
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Add ``edx_drf_extensions_version`` to help with rollout of changes in this library across services.

Removed
~~~~~~~

* Removed exception case for ``InvalidTokenError`` that was never invoked.

[8.6.0] - 2023-04-12
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added ``jwt_auth_check_symmetric_key``, ``jwt_auth_asymmetric_verified``, ``jwt_auth_symmetric_verified``, and ``jwt_auth_verification_failed`` custom attributes to aid in deprecation and removal of symmetric keys.
* Added ``jwt_auth_issuer`` and ``jwt_auth_issuer_verification`` custom attributes.

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Changed ``jwt_auth_verify_keys_count`` custom attribute to aid in key rotations, to instead be ``jwt_auth_verify_asymmetric_keys_count`` and ``jwt_auth_verify_all_keys_count``. The latter count is only used in the case that the token can't be verified with the asymmetric keys alone.

[8.5.3] - 2023-04-11
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

* (Hopefully) fixed the ability to publish edx-drf-extensions, by adding a ``long_description`` to setup.py. There was no real 8.5.1 or 8.5.2.

[8.5.0] - 2023-04-05
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added ``jwt_auth_verify_keys_count`` custom attribute to aid in key rotations

[8.4.1] - 2022-12-18
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Additional logging in `authenticate_credentials` within the JWT authentication middleware for debugging purposes.

[8.4.0] - 2022-12-16
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added custom attribute enduser.id, following OpenTelemetry convention. This works with some New Relic automatic tooling around users. The old custom attribute request_user_id should be considered deprecated.

[8.3.1] - 2022-09-09
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~~~

* Fixed disabled user error by reverting change to JwtAuthentication.

[8.3.0] - 2022-09-07
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* JwtAuthentication will fail for disabled users (with unusable password).

[8.2.0] - 2022-08-24
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added only asymmetric jwt decoding functionality in decoder

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Rename toggle_warnings to toggle_warning for consistency with setting_warning.

[8.1.0] - 2022-01-28
--------------------

Dropped
~~~~~~~

* Dropped Support for Django22, 30, 31

[8.0.1] - 2021-11-01
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Resolve RemovedInDjango4.0 warnings.


[8.0.0] - 2021-09-30
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Updated ``EnsureJWTAuthSettingsMiddleware`` to understand and work with permissions combined using DRF's in-built support. This allows switching away from ``rest_condition``. Any view that still uses ``rest_condition`` will cause the middleware to throw an error.


[7.0.1] - 2021-08-10
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

* Removed dropped ``require_exp`` and ``require_iat`` options from jwt.decode and instead used ``require`` option with both ``exp`` and ``iat``. For more info visit this: https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#dropped-deprecated-require-options-in-jwt-decode
* This fixes an error in previous release which had a multiple breaking changes


[7.0.0] - 2021-08-03
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** ``generate_jwt_token``: Now returns string (instead of bytes), and no longer requires decoding. This was to keep consistent with change to ``jwt.encode`` in `pyjwt` upgrade (see below).
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Upgraded dependency ``pyjwt[crypto]`` to 2.1.0, which introduces its own breaking changes that may affect consumers of this library. Pay careful attention to the 2.0.0 breaking changes documented in https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-0-0.

[6.6.0] - 2021-07-13
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added support for django3.1 and 3.2

[6.5.0] - 2021-02-12
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added a new custom attribute `jwt_auth_failed` to both monitor failures, and to help prepare for future refactors.


[6.4.0] - 2021-01-19
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Added a new custom attribute `request_is_staff_or_superuser`

[6.3.0] - 2021-01-12
--------------------

Removed
~~~~~~~

* Drop support for Python 3.5

[6.2.0] - 2020-08-24
--------------------

Updated
~~~~~~~

* Renamed "custom metric" to "custom attribute" throughout the repo. This was based on a `decision (ADR) captured in edx-django-utils`_.

  * Deprecated RequestMetricsMiddleware due to rename.  Use RequestCustomAttributesMiddleware instead.

.. _`decision (ADR) captured in edx-django-utils`: https://github.com/openedx/edx-django-utils/blob/master/edx_django_utils/monitoring/docs/decisions/0002-custom-monitoring-language.rst

[6.1.2] - 2020-07-19
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~~~

* `_get_user_from_jwt` no longer throws an `UnsupportedMediaType` error for failing to parse "new user" requests.



[6.1.1] - 2020-07-19
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~~~

* Latest `drf-jwt` is throwing error in case of any other Authorization Header. Fixing that issue in `JwtAuthentication` class.



[6.1.0] - 2020-06-26
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Update `drf-jwt` to pull in new allow-list(they called it blacklist) feature.

Added
~~~~~

Fixed
~~~~~



[6.0.0] - 2020-05-05
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed 'request_auth_type' to 'request_auth_type_guess'. This makes it more clear that this metric could report the wrong value in certain cases. This could break dashboards or alerts that relied on this metric.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed value `session-or-unknown` to `session-or-other`. This name makes it more clear that it is the method of authentication that is in question, not whether or not the user is authenticated. This could break dashboards or alerts that relied on this metric.

Added
~~~~~

* Added 'jwt-cookie' as new value for 'request_auth_type_guess'.
* Added new 'request_authenticated_user_found_in_middleware' metric. Helps identify for what middleware step the request user was set, if it was set. Example values: 'process_request', 'process_view', 'process_response', or 'process_exception'.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fixed/Added setting of authentication metrics for exceptions as well.
* Fixed 'request_auth_type_guess' to be more accurate when recording values of 'unauthenticated' and 'no-user'.
